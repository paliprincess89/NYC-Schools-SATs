# Are SAT Scores a Fair Test for All Students?

### For this analysis, we will be using the New York City published data on student SAT scores by high school along with other demographic datasets to answer the following questions:

* <b>Which fields from the data have a high correlation with SAT scores?<br/>
<br/>
* For those fields with high correlation with SAT scores: are their other patterns we can find as we deep dive into those correlations?<br/>
<br/>
* Does race, economic wellfare, district, or any other demographic play a role in SAT scores?</b>

### In our analysis we will be using a combined pandas dataframe that includes the following datasets:

* <b>SAT scores by school</b> - SAT scores for each high school in New York City
* <b>School attendance</b> - Attendance information for each school in New York City
* <b>Class size</b> - Information on class size for each school
* <b>AP test results</b> - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)
* <b>Graduation outcomes</b> - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information
* <b>Demographics</b> - Demographic information for each school
* <b>School survey</b> - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school

## Summary of Final Analysis/Conclusion of Student Demographics/Survey Catagories vs. SAT Scores:

+ There is a clear negative relationship between ELL, FRL, Black, and Hispanic students and the SAT scores.
+ On average, Asian and White students have an advantage over Black and Hispanic students when it comes to SAT scores in NYC.
+ Schools with the highest SAT scores are ones with between 40-75% female student body, or between 30-70% male student body
+ Both ELL and race (namely Asian and Hispanic) play a role in average SAT scores for schools.
+ While ELL overall negatively correlates with SAT, Asian ELL students tend to do better on average than Hispanic ELL students on the SATs.

It's important to note that this study does not have enough data available to be able to drill down further on why race plays a role in the SATs, only that it does. This is not an indication that any race is more or less intelligent than another, it is merely an observational data point and there can be many contributing factors in the reasons behind these differences. In order to further study this, we would need to look into students' enviromental and cultural differences, neighborhoods, parents' education, family income, student employment, etc.

## Reading in the data


```python
# Importing all necessary language dictionaries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import re
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
import seaborn as sns
import geopandas as gpd
from shapely import wkt
import geopy
import matplotlib.cm
from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap
```


```python
# Importing all the data files and combining them into 1
data_files = [
    "ap_2010.csv",
    "class_size.csv",
    "demographics.csv",
    "graduation.csv",
    "hs_directory.csv",

]
# Removing '.csv' and formatting all files
data = {}

for f in data_files:
    d = pd.read_csv("schools/{0}".format(f))
    data[f.replace(".csv", "")] = d
```

## Reading in the surveys


```python
# Reading in the survey data, using tab spaced format, and encoding so it is readable
# Concatenating 'all_survey' and 'd75_survey'
all_survey = pd.read_csv("schools/survey_all.txt", delimiter="\t", encoding='windows-1252')
d75_survey = pd.read_csv("schools/survey_d75.txt", delimiter="\t", encoding='windows-1252')
survey = pd.concat([all_survey, d75_survey], axis=0)

# Updating the'dbn' field to capital letters
survey["DBN"] = survey["dbn"]
# Listing the survey fields in a variable
survey_fields = [
    "DBN",

    "aca_tot_11",
]

# Creating a DataFrame called 'survey' with all survey fields as columns 
survey = survey.loc[:,survey_fields]
data["survey"] = survey

# Updating the column names in survey for readability
col_names = {'rr_s': 'Student Response Rate', 'rr_t': 'Teacher Response Rate', 'rr_p': 'Parent Response Rate',

## Updating 'dbn' to 'DBN' (Database Numbers) column


```python
# Capitalizing 'dbn' column name
data["hs_directory"]["DBN"] = data["hs_directory"]["dbn"]

# Changing 'CSD' to 'padded_csd'
def pad_csd(num):
    string_representation = str(num)
    if len(string_representation) > 1:
        return string_representation
    else:
        return "0" + string_representation
    
data["class_size"]["padded_csd"] = data["class_size"]["CSD"].apply(pad_csd)

```

## Converting columns to numeric


```python
# Converting SAT results to numeric
cols = ['SAT Math Avg. Score', 'SAT Critical Reading Avg. Score', 'SAT Writing Avg. Score']
for c in cols:
    data["sat_results"][c] = pd.to_numeric(data["sat_results"][c], errors="coerce")

data['sat_results']['sat_score'] = data['sat_results'][cols[0]] + data['sat_results'][cols[1]] + data['sat_results'][cols[2]]

# Adding coordinates of schools to locate their districts
def find_lat(loc):
    coords = re.findall("\(.+, .+\)", loc)
    lat = coords[0].split(",")[0].replace("(", "")
    return lat

    coords = re.findall("\(.+, .+\)", loc)
    lon = coords[0].split(",")[1].replace(")", "").strip()
    return lon

data["hs_directory"]["lat"] = data["hs_directory"]["Location 1"].apply(find_lat)

data["hs_directory"]["lat"] = pd.to_numeric(data["hs_directory"]["lat"], errors="coerce")
data["hs_directory"]["lon"] = pd.to_numeric(data["hs_directory"]["lon"], errors="coerce")
```

## Condensing datasets


```python
# Condensing dataset 'class_size' and only including high school grades '09-12' in 'GEN ED'
class_size = data["class_size"]
class_size = class_size[class_size["GRADE "] == "09-12"]

# Converting 'class_size' to a mean grouped by 'DBN'
class_size = class_size.groupby("DBN").agg(np.mean)
class_size.reset_index(inplace=True)
data["class_size"] = class_size

# Only including demographics from school years 2011 and 2012
data["demographics"] = data["demographics"][data["demographics"]["schoolyear"] == 20112012]

# Filtering for 'graduation' on 'Cohort' of 2006 and 'Demographic' of 'Total Cohort'
data["graduation"] = data["graduation"][data["graduation"]["Cohort"] == "2006"]
data["graduation"] = data["graduation"][data["graduation"]["Demographic"] == "Total Cohort"]
```

## Converting AP scores to numeric


```python
# Converting AP columns to numeric
cols = ['AP Test Takers ', 'Total Exams Taken', 'Number of Exams with scores 3 4 or 5']

for col in cols:
    data["ap_2010"][col] = pd.to_numeric(data["ap_2010"][col], errors="coerce")
```

## Combining the datasets


```python
# Merging the datasets into a DataFrame called 'combined'
combined = data["sat_results"]
combined = combined.merge(data["ap_2010"], on="DBN", how="left")
combined = combined.merge(data["graduation"], on="DBN", how="left")
to_merge = ["class_size", "demographics", "survey", "hs_directory"]

for m in to_merge:
    combined = combined.merge(data[m], on="DBN", how="inner")
    
combined = combined.fillna(combined.mean())
combined = combined.fillna(0)
```


```python
pd.options.display.max_columns = None
display(combined.head(3))

## Analyzing survey_fields correlation with SAT score:

We will omit the N_s (number of students), N_t (number of teachers), and N_p (number of parents) from the results as these only tell us the number of responses the survey received from each category.

The strongest correlations are with the student and teacher response rates for safety as well as total safety rating (saf_s_11, saf_t_11, saf_tot_11), and the student response for academia (aca_s_11). This may mean that the safer the school feels, the easier it is for students to learn, or it might be other contributing factors that come with safer schools. However, the parent response rate seems to have a much weaker correlation, which is a bit surprising and proposes the question of whether there's a disconnect between how parents think/feel about their children's school safety versus reality.

The student responses on their school's academia have a high correlation with SAT score and that makes sense since the students who feel that the academic level of their school is high (i.e. - they are confident in their learning) are probably also doing well on the SATs. The remaining fields in the survey (communication, engagement) don't seem to have a strong correlation for either the students, teachers, or parents, but may have some slight correlation.

Another interesting point to note is that communication score of the school based on parent rating (com_p_11) has a slight negative correlation with SAT, which could indicate that lower SAT scores may have something to do with how well the school communicates with the parents. If the parents are being communicated with regularly about their child's academic performance, they are probably more likely to get more involved and possibly ensure their child's academia improves.

## Analysis of correlation between safety and SAT scores:
From looking at the scatter plots above, there is a definite correlation between the students rating of school safety and their SAT scores. The higher the safety rating, the higher the SAT Scores for the most part (with some outliers). The majority of schools seem to have a low to mid-range safety score and a corresponding low to mid-range average SAT score. There are not many schools with safety scores above 8.0, and also not many schools with average SAT scores above 1600. There are about 5 schools with very high safety scores (above 8.0) that also have mid-range average SAT Scores (between 1100-1500).


```python
# Looking at the schools with high student safety scores and low-mid SAT scores (below 1500)      
high_saf_low_sat = combined[(combined['sat_score'] <= 1500.0) & (combined['saf_s_11'] >= 8.0)]
print (high_saf_low_sat.shape)
```

    (6, 164)



```python
# Looking at the schools with lower than 8.0 student safety scores and high SAT scores (below 1500)      
high_sat_low_saf = combined[(combined['sat_score'] > 1500.0) & (combined['saf_s_11'] < 8.0)]
print (high_sat_low_saf.shape)
```

## Analyzing the above two bar graphs

We should take all of this data with a grain of salt, given that there are far fewer schools in the data for the first graph (6 schools) than the second (19 schools) and that this can skew the data.

What's interesting in the findings of these 2 graphs is that we can see a clear difference in 'frl_percent' (students enrolled in the Free and Reduced Lunch program), as well as the 'race' fields. 'frl_percent' has a high negative correlation with sat_score in the first graph (the lower SAT Score and higher safety rating graph), and only has a slight negative correlation in the second graph (higher SAT Score and slightly lower safety ratings). This seems to indicate that students who are enrolled in the FRL program tend to get lower SAT scores, and it's worth looking into to find out why. It's possible that the type of food they are eating in this program is negatively impacting the students cognition and ultimately their test scores, or that the students who qualify for these programs have other factors in their lives that are negatively impacting their performance. 


The 'asian_per' or Asian percent of student body field is much more highly correlated with the SAT Scores in the second graph than the first, and the 'black_per' and 'hispanic_per' or Black percent and Hispanic percent of student body are much more negatively correlated with the second graph than the first. This means that Asian students are more likely to have higher SAT Scores, and Black and Hispanic students are more likely to have lower SAT Scores. White students also have a fairly big difference in the first to second graph with a slightly positive correlation in the first graph and a slight negative correlation in the second graph. Again, this is worth exploring further to try to find the reasons for the big discrepancies between the students' races and SAT Scores. 

Another point that stands out is the 'male_per' and 'female_per' fields, which represent male and female student body percentages respectively. Male percentage has a slight positive correlation and female has a slight negative correlation in the first graph and both more than double in correlation in the second graph. It seems female students do more poorly in SAT Scores in this group than males and this is also worth exploring.

One more point that is worth exploring here is the 'com_t_11' field which represents the communication score based on teacher responses from the school surveys. This field has a high positive correlation in the first graph and a fairly negative correlation in the second graph. It seems that although safety and teacher communication scores are high, it doesn't necessarily mean that students SAT Scores will be high, although they may help slightly. The overall SAT Scores in the first graph are generally low or at best mid. What is interesting is that the teacher communication score in the second graph seems to say that teacher communication scores are generally lower in schools with high SAT Score Averages.

## Summary of Average Safety and SAT Scores by Borough:

+ Staten Island has far fewer schools than all other boroughs, with only 10 schools.
+ Staten Island also has the highest avg. SAT score but given it has only 10 schools, it's not really a fair comparison - but it is worth noting.
+ Manhatten has the highest safety rating by students, but not the highest SAT scores.
+ Brooklyn has the lowest safety rating by students but is surprisingly not the lowest in avg. SAT score.
+ The Bronx has the lowest avg. SAT score, although it is 3rd in safety ratings by students.
+ There doesn't seem to be any direct relationship between student safety ratings of schools and avg. SAT score by borough.

We can see above that there are some districts that have both the least and most safe schools according to student safety ratings (districts 13 and 14), which could mean that safety can come down to certain neighborhoods within districts, or it could mean that some schools have more safety measures in place to make students feel safer.

## Analyzing the above graph

We can see a clear negative correlation between FRL program enrollment and SAT Scores. We can also see that the majority of enrollees in the FRL program are Hispanic, and that the majority of White students are not enrolled in the program. This indicates that the majority of Hispanic students belong to lower income families, and the majority of white students do not. We can also see that there is a correlation between the FRL program and ELL enrolled students (English Language Learners), which could be a big factor in the lower SAT scores.

## Analzying the race and SAT score correlation:

+ From the bar graphs above, it seems that there are overall more black and hispanic students than white or asian students in NY high schools in general, but different schools have different distributions of race. 
+ From the graphs we can see that schools with lower percentages of black and hispanic students on average do better on the SATs, than schools with higher percents of black and hispanic students. 
+ The opposite seems to be true of white and asian students, where the higher the percent of them at a school, the higher the SAT scores are on average. This does not tell us that certain races are smarter than others, but it does tell us there is a correlation between race and SAT scores that need to be explored further to understand why there is a racial gap in SAT scores. 

Contributing factors may be such things as school safety, socio-economic status, parents education as well as their engagement in students academic life, communication between schools and parents, do they live in a single parent or multi-parent home, what the students home-life and extra-curricular life is like, school resources and budget, student attendance, as well as many other factors.

Another thing to look into would be the outlier schools with high percentages of black or hispanic students and high SAT scores, to see what sets them apart from the other schools.

## Exploring schools with high hispanic rates and low SAT scores


```python
scatterplot(combined['sat_score'], combined['hispanic_per'], 'purple', 
            'Sat Score', 'Percent of Hispanic Students', 
            'Percent of Hispanic Students vs. SAT Scores')
```


    
![png](output_71_0.png)
    


## Analyzing the Hispanic student percent correlation with SAT score:
The scatter plot shows there is a fairly high negative correlation between the percent of hispanic students in NY high schools and SAT scores. The schools with below 25% hispanic students on average do much better on the SAT than the schools with above 25% hispanic student body. The majority of NY schools have higher than 25% hispanic student body, with the majority averaging less 1500 SAT score. The high schools with the highest rates of hispanic students (80% or higher) skew towards even lower SAT scores with under 1400. If we consider that ESL students also do not do well on the SAT, my prediction is we may see a lot of overlap with the hispanic student population and the ESL student SAT scores.


```python
hisp_schools = combined[combined['hispanic_per'] > 95]
```


```python
# separating just the columns we want to compare
hisp_schools.loc[:,'ap_test_takers_per'] = round(hisp_schools.loc[:,'AP Test Takers ']/hisp_schools.loc[:,'total_enrollment'],2)*100

## Summary of the high schools with 95%+ hispanic enrollment:

+ The main point that stands out to me is that the high rate of ELL students at these schools has a high negative correlation with SAT Scores. 
 + It's possible that if the exams were given in the students first language, that we could see much higher scores.
+ Female Hispanic students have a high negative correlation and male Hispanic students have a high positive correlation with SAT scores, although the actual percents are not much different.
+ FRL is a bit too all over the place to really see a pattern, but has a slightly positive correlation with SAT scores.
+ I think it's important to note that even where we see a relatively high enrollment in AP participation, we still see low SAT scores for these schools with high ELL and economic disadvantage. There doesn't seem to be much correlation between AP Test Taking and SAT Scores.
+ Interestingly, the larger the class size, the higher the SAT Scores average seems to be (although not much higher).

```


```python
# separating just the important columns
non_hisp_schools.loc[:,'AP_test_takers_per'] = round((non_hisp_schools.loc[:,'AP Test Takers '])/(non_hisp_schools.loc[:,'total_enrollment']),2)*100
non_hisp_schools.loc[:,'average_class_size'] = round(non_hisp_schools.loc[:,'AVERAGE CLASS SIZE'],2)
non_hisp_schools_frl_ell = non_hisp_schools.loc[:, ('SCHOOL NAME', 'sat_score', 'frl_percent', 'ell_percent', 'male_per', 'female_per', 'AP_test_takers_per', 'total_enrollment', 'average_class_size')]
non_hisp_schools_frl_ell = non_hisp_schools_frl_ell.set_index('SCHOOL NAME')

## Summary of the high schools with < 10% hispanic enrollment & > 1800 SAT score:


+ There is a disparage between rates of FRL enrolled students between these schools and the majority hispanic schools.
+ Huge disparage in ELL percent between these schools and the majority hispanic schools.
+ Also there's a slight negative correlation between ELL percent at these schools and SAT scores.
+ Race percentages seem to matter greatly to the data. 

## Plotting correlations between gender and SAT Score

plt.figure(figsize=(20,8))
scattersubs(1, 2, 1, combined['sat_score'], combined['male_per'],
           'lightblue', 'red', 'Percent of Male Students v SAT Score',
           'Sat Score', 
           'Percent of Male Students')

           'pink', 'red', 'Percent of Female Students v SAT Score',
           'Sat Score', 
           'Percent of Female Students')
plt.show()
```

## Analyzing the correlation between gender and SAT score
From the correlation scatter plots we can see there is a very slight negative correlation between male student percentage and SAT score and a slightly positive one for female percentage and SAT score. This doesn't surprise me but it will be interesting to look into why there's an opposite correlation between the genders.

## Exploring female_per v. SAT score
What I find interesting in the above scatter plot is that the 5 schools that are 100% female do average or poorly on the SAT, as well as all the schools with below about 30% female student body. The schools with the highest SAT scores are ones with between 40-75% female student body (with the exception of one at about 30-35%). The majority of the schools that do poorly or average on the SAT fall somewhere between 35-60% female student body (this is also true for males).


```python
high_fem_schools = combined[(combined['female_per'] > 55) & (combined['sat_score'] > 1700)]
```


```python
# separating just the 'SCHOOL NAME', 'sat_score', frl_percent' and 'ell_percent' columns
high_fem_schools_data = high_fem_schools.loc[:, ('SCHOOL NAME', 'sat_score', 'frl_percent', 'ell_percent', 'asian_per', 'white_per', 'black_per', 'hispanic_per')]
high_fem_schools_data = high_fem_schools_data.set_index('SCHOOL NAME')
high_fem_schools_data

## Summary of male student percent vs. SAT scores:

+ The main takeaway is black and hispanic male students have a much higher negative correlation than female black and hispanic students.
+ Also ELL has a lower (negative) correlation with SAT in male students than in female students.

## Exploring AP Test Takers v SAT score


```python
combined['ap_per'] = (combined['AP Test Takers ']/combined['total_enrollment'])*100
```


```python
scatterplot(combined['sat_score'], combined['ap_per'], 'blue', 
            'Sat Score', 'Percent of Students who took 1+ AP Exams', 
            'Percent of AP Test Takers v SAT Score')
```

## Summary of AP Test Takers Percent v SAT score
From the above scatter plot, we can see there is a very slight positive correlation between students who took at least 1 AP Exam and SAT scores. What I find most interesting about the data, is that once the percent of test takers is above 55%, the SAT scores actually remain relatively low at around 1200. There seems to be kind of a sweet spot at between 20-55% where there are some schools with SAT scores above 1600. We can see from the plot that below 10% AP Exam takers typically don't do as well on the SATs with all below 1600 average, and the majority in the 1000-1300 range. The schools that do the best on the SATs (1800+) mostly have around 40-55% AP Test Takers.

Let's explore the schools that do best, a little further and see if there are any patterns.


```python
ap_high_SAT_schools = combined[(combined['ap_per'] > .4) & (combined['sat_score'] > 1800)]
```


```python
# separating just the 'SCHOOL NAME', 'sat_score', frl_percent' and 'ell_percent' columns
ap_high_SAT_schools_data = ap_high_SAT_schools[['SCHOOL NAME', 'sat_score', 'frl_percent', 'ell_percent', 'asian_per', 'white_per', 'black_per', 'hispanic_per']]
ap_high_SAT_schools_data = ap_high_SAT_schools_data.set_index('SCHOOL NAME')
ap_high_SAT_schools_data
```

## Summary of schools with above 40% AP percent of students and SAT scores above 1800:

+ The main takeaway here is ELL students are nearly non-existant at these schools, with the highest percent of ELL being 0.20%.
+ Another takeaway is there are higher percentages of Asian and White students at these schools and they seem to have an advantage over Black and Hispanic students when it comes to SAT scores.
+ Black and Hispanic students have relatively high negative correlation with SAT scores at 0.74 and 0.60 respectively.


```python
# Just so we can see which boroughs these schools are in:
ap_high_SAT_schools_boro = ap_high_SAT_schools[['SCHOOL NAME', 'sat_score', 'borough']]
ap_high_SAT_schools_boro

# There doesn't seem to be much pattern here besides Queens having 2 schools on the list

## Exploring Asian percentages v SAT score

## Analyzing Asian percentage v. SAT score
There is a clear positive correlation between Asian percentage of student body vs. SAT score. We've noted this pattern already while analyzing other segments of the data, so let's explore it a little further.


```python
asian_per_bronx = combined[(combined['asian_per'] > 40) & (combined['borough'] == 'Bronx')]

asian_per_brooklyn = combined[(combined['asian_per'] > 40) & (combined['borough'] == 'Brooklyn')]

asian_per_manhattan = combined[(combined['asian_per'] > 40) & (combined['borough'] == 'Manhattan')]

asian_per_statenisland = combined[(combined['asian_per'] > 40) & (combined['borough'] == 'Staten Island')]

asian_per_queens = combined[(combined['asian_per'] > 40) & (combined['borough'] == 'Queens')]

asian_per_boro = [asian_per_bronx, asian_per_brooklyn, asian_per_manhattan, asian_per_statenisland, asian_per_queens]
```


```python
asian_schools_per_boro = [len(asian_per_bronx['SCHOOL NAME']), len(asian_per_brooklyn['SCHOOL NAME']), len(asian_per_manhattan['SCHOOL NAME']), len(asian_per_statenisland['SCHOOL NAME']), len(asian_per_queens['SCHOOL NAME'])]
asian_schools_per_boro
```




    [1, 4, 5, 0, 11]



We can see the following breakdown from the above datasets:</br>
* Bronx = 1 school with > 40% Asian
* Brooklyn = 4 schools with > 40% Asian
* Manhattan = 5 schools with > 40% Asian
* Staten Island = 0 schools with > 40% Asian
* Queens = 11 schools with > 40% Asian


```python
for boro in asian_per_boro:
    asian_schools_data = (boro[['SCHOOL NAME', 'sat_score', 'asian_per', 'white_per', 'black_per', 'hispanic_per', 'frl_percent', 'ell_percent', 'ap_per']])
    print (asian_schools_data)

## Summary of schools with 'asian_per' above 40% per borough v. SAT score:
+ From the above data, we can see that there is a high negative correlation with ell_percent and low SAT scores, even when the student body is over 40% Asian. 
+ The highest scores are attributed to those schools with less than 10% English Language Learners (ELL), and the lowest scores to those with more than 80% ELL.
+ There is a big difference in how well each race does from borough to borough.
 + Asian students have the highest correlation with SAT scores in Brooklyn (for these schools), and only a slight positive correlation in Queens.
 
Let's explore the ell_percent and SAT score further.

## Exploring English Language Learners (ELL) v. SAT score:


```python
scatterplot(combined['sat_score'], combined['ell_percent'], 'blue', 
            'Sat Score', 'Percent of ELL Students', 
            'Percent of ELL Students v SAT Score')
plt.show()
```


    
![png](output_123_0.png)
    



```python
ELL_SAT_corr = combined.corr()['sat_score']['ell_percent']
print ('The correlation between ELL percent and SAT scores is:', ELL_SAT_corr)
```

    The correlation between ELL percent and SAT scores is: -0.3987497322085199


## Analyzing ELL percent v. SAT score:
We can see there is a negative correlation between the percent of ELL students in a school and SAT scores. There are no schools with above 40% ELL students that have more than a 1300 average SAT score. Only 1 school with close to 40% has more than 1400 average SAT score. This most likely indicates that the SAT is an unfair assessment for ELL students, especially since the SAT is only given in English and there may be many students who are not yet proficient in English by the time they take the SAT.

## Exploring ELL with Race v. SAT score


```python
asian_per_ell = combined[(combined['asian_per'] > 40) & (combined['ell_percent'] > 60)]

white_per_ell = combined[(combined['white_per'] > 40) & (combined['ell_percent'] > 60)]

black_per_ell = combined[(combined['black_per'] > 40) & (combined['ell_percent'] > 60)]

hispanic_per_ell = combined[(combined['hispanic_per'] > 40) & (combined['ell_percent'] > 60)]

race_per_ell = [asian_per_ell, white_per_ell, black_per_ell, hispanic_per_ell]
```


```python
race_per_ell_schools = [len(asian_per_ell['SCHOOL NAME']), len(white_per_ell['SCHOOL NAME']), len(black_per_ell['SCHOOL NAME']), len(hispanic_per_ell['SCHOOL NAME'])]
race_per_ell_schools
```




    [6, 0, 0, 17]



+ There are 6 schools with >40% Asian student body and >60% ELL student percent.
+ 0 schools with >40% White or Black student body and >60% ELL student percent.
+ And 17 schools with >40% Hispanic student body and >60% ELL student percent.

## Summary of ELL Percent vs. SAT scores:

+ There is a slight negative correlation with ELL percent and SAT scores for these schools but actually we can see that for schools with high ELL (above 60%), the SAT score average does not go above 1223.44 which is relatively low.
+ There are some outliers in the data that are interesting, we can see in the above bar graph that some of the schools with very high ELL percent (86.9% and 94.9%) have some of the highest SAT scores within this group. While it's still not a high SAT score, it's still interesting that despite the very high ELL, the students got a higher average SAT score than others with lower ELL percent.


```python
# Separating the schools with the highest SAT scores of the above group (high ELL)
hsat_ell_schools_data = race_ell_schools_data[(race_ell_schools_data['sat_score'] > 1200.0)]
print (hsat_ell_schools_data)

print ('\n')

# Separating the schools with the lowest SAT scores of the above group (high ELL)
lsat_ell_schools_data = race_ell_schools_data[(race_ell_schools_data['sat_score'] < 950.0)]
print (lsat_ell_schools_data)
```

+ The International High School At Union Square has the highest ELL percent but also one of the highest SAT scores for the group. 
+ What's interesting is that the Asian percent is much higher here with 40.3%, which may account for the difference in SAT scores, despite the ELL percent.
+ All of the schools with below 950 SAT avg score have above 70% Hispanic student body, as well as above 79% ELL percent.
+ The lowest SAT scoring school is nearly 100% Hispanic and has 94.6% ELL percent which is the second highest ELL.
+ This indicates that both ELL and race play a role in SAT scores.

There may be something culturally that is driving the difference between Asian ELL students and Hispanic ELL students, or it may be environmental, or something unforeseen.

## Summary of schools with 'hispanic_per' above 40% per borough v. SAT score:

+ Hispanic students at schools with above 40% Hispanic student body have a negative correlation with SAT scores in every borough.
+ A very surprising point in this data is that ELL percent is lower in these schools than in the >40% Asian schools.
+ Even when ELL percent is not highly negatively correlated with SAT scores, Hispanic students still have about the same negative correlation with SAT scores.
+ Oddly, AP percent has a negative correlation with SAT scores for these schools.
+ SAT scores on average are much lower for these schools than the 40%+ Asian schools by borough.

## Final Analysis/Conclusion of Student Demographics/Survey Catagories vs. SAT Scores:

+ There is a clear negative relationship between ELL students and the SAT scores.
+ Another clear negative relationship is between FRL enrolled students and SAT scores.
+ On average, Asian and White students have an advantage over Black and Hispanic students when it comes to SAT scores in NYC.
+ Schools with the highest SAT scores are ones with between 40-75% female student body, or between 30-70% male student body
+ Both ELL and race (namely Asian and Hispanic) play a role in average SAT scores for schools.
+ While ELL overall negatively correlates with SAT, Asian ELL students tend to do better on average than Hispanic ELL students on the SATs.
+ While AP Test Takers generally have a fairly positive correlation with SAT scores, they have a slightly negative correlation with SAT scores in schools with high Hispanic and ELL percent, and in Manhattan in schools with high Asian and ELL percent.

It's important to note that this study does not have enough data available to be able to drill down further on why race plays a role in the SATs, only that it does. This is not an indication that any race is more or less intelligent than another, it is merely an observational data point and there can be many contributing factors in the reasons behind these differences. In order to further study this, we would need to look into students' enviromental and cultural differences, neighborhoods, parents' education, family income, student employment, history, etc.

Some of the factors of this disparage may be due to parental help or encouragement in the home/involvement in students academia, it could be due to economic disadvantagement being a hinderance to academia, and may affect some races differently than others (i.e. - if one race/culture is more likely to ask students to work to help their family, where another might place more importance on academia even if they are economically disadvantaged), but it needs further study to know for sure what is driving the differences. One thing seems to be for sure, and that is that language barriers (ELL) definitely have a major impact on SAT scores, and possibly on academia in general. 

It is also clear that economic disadvantagement contributes to lower SAT scores (FRL enrollment shows economic disadvantagement). This could also be due to a number of factors, and would need further study. Some factors may be biological, as there are studies that nutrition and nurishment directly affect the brain and may affect the ability to learn and retain information. While these students may be provided meals at school, we don't know what their nutrition is like in their home but we know from other studies that often lower-income neighborhoods are in the middle of 'food deserts'. Another factor could be that economic disadvantagement usually goes hand-in-hand with other disadvantages such as single-parent homes, parents working multiple jobs (less time spent with students), student employment (working to help their family), lower-income neighborhoods with higher rates of crime (less safety and stability in environment, poor influences, less importance placed on academia and more importance placed on survival, not enough community resources), etc.

The data we've analyzed in this project shows us that the SAT exams do not seem to be a fair assessment for all students. We can clearly see that students who are learning English as a second language, as well as Hispanic and Black students are at a disadvantage when it comes to SATs. We can also see that economic disadvantagement places students at an academic disadvantage. Schools with more than 75% female student body and more than 70% male student body also do worse on average than schools with between 40-75% female or 30-70% male student body. Further study would help us understand the reasons behind all these differences. In general, it would seem that there needs to be either a different system to measure students' academic retention/performance or there needs to be changes made to the SATs to ensure fairness.
